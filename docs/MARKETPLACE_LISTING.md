# GitHub Marketplace Listing – OmniSync Edge White Label Package

## 🏷️ Title
OmniSync Edge – White Label Self-Hosting Orchestration

## ✨ Tagline
Turn workflows into $2M ARR with white‑label, self‑hosted orchestration.

## 📖 Description
OmniSync Edge is a **GitHub‑native orchestration starter kit**.  
It lets agencies, SaaS teams, and consultants instantly deploy a backend that:  
- Runs on **Supabase Edge Functions**  
- Bills via **Stripe usage metering**  
- Offers a **White‑Label Self‑Hosting Transition Model** (3‑phase client lifecycle)  

**How It Works**
1. Client starts hosted for 3 months ($5K/mo)  
2. You charge $15K–25K for self‑hosting transfer  
3. They keep paying $1K–2K/mo for your orchestration API (95%+ margin)  

👉 Result: ~$53K Year‑1 value per client. 38 clients = $2M ARR.

## 🎯 Who It’s For
- **Agencies** (CRM, recruiting, marketing, real estate)  
- **Mid‑market enterprises ($10M–$100M)** that want orchestration but not vendor lock‑in  
- **Consultants & SaaS founders** who want a turnkey backend to monetize  

## 🚀 Key Benefits
- ⚡ **One‑Click Install** – deploy with GitHub Actions  
- 🧠 **6 Edge Functions pre‑built** (intake, retries, bandit optimization)  
- 💸 **Stripe usage billing out‑of‑the‑box**  
- 🗄️ **Multi‑tenant SQL schema** with RLS + API keys  
- 📚 **Comprehensive docs** & Postman/VS Code collections  
- 🔑 **White‑Label Playbook** included (docs + images + PDF sales sheet)  

## 💸 Pricing
- **Free Tier** – 1,000 API calls/month included  
- **Pay‑As‑You‑Go** – $0.05 per call beyond free tier  
- **White‑Label Implementation** – $15K–25K fee (self‑hosting transfer)  
- **API Access Forever** – $1K–2K/mo recurring  

👉 Position it like AWS billing: Pay for what you use, then graduate to self‑hosting independence.
